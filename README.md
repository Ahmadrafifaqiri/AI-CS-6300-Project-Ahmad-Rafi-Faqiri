Project Title: PacmanAI Student Name: Ahmad Rafi Faqiri UID: u1503285 Project Link: PacmanAI Project

 Overview  Project Sections Covered: Search Algorithms: This section involves the implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are utilized to address navigation and traveling salesman problems within the Pacman environment.  Multi-Agent Search: Classic Pacman is conceptualized as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. In this part of the project, I implemented multi-agent minimax and expectimax algorithms, along with the design of evaluation functions.  Reinforcement Learning: Here, I developed both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms were applied to various scenarios, including the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.  Ghostbusters: This section focuses on probabilistic inference within a hidden Markov model to track the movement of concealed ghosts in the Pacman world. I implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference through particle filters.
